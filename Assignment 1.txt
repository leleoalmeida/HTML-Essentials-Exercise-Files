Welcome to your first challenge! In this course’s challenges, you’ll work on completing the HTML Essential Training reference site. You won’t be building the site from scratch, rather you’ll be completing various portions of the site in varying degrees of completion. The goal is to reinforce and put into practice what you’ve learned in this chapter.

For this challenge you’ll be planning and implementing a formatting strategy for the site. In the steps below I’ll list the tasks you need to perform, as well as the relevant files for each task.


			
6.	Inserting Images
	     a.	Applies to: Intro.htm
	     b.	Examine the existing image at the top of the page. Note the class “flowRight” which is used by CSS to control styling. You’ll learn more about this in the chapter on CSS.
	     c.	Scroll down until you locate the paragraph “Shortly After the 1.0 specification…” At the beginning of that paragraph insert an image that:
                  i.	points to the 200px-W3C_icon.png in the _images directory
                  ii.	uses the alt text “W3C logo”
		  iii.	passes the value of 200 for width, and 136 for height
		  iv.	applies a class of “flowLeft”
